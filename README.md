# To bee or not to be
Analysis of beehives trends causations throughout the years

# Abstract
Reportedly, in recent years there has been a decrease in the number of beehives in the world. We believe there is not only one reason for that, and our goal is to try to find out what are the possible causations. The dataset we are using is about global food and agriculture statistics and it is provided by the United Nations. Our motivation for the project topic comes from the reason that bees are not only important for producing honey and other bee products, but they also play an important role in the pollination process which is necessary for the production of fruits. First, we would like to gain deeper insights into trends in the number of beehives per country and later on try to correlate the change in the trend with other factors. To conclude, we would like to train a model which could predict what will happen with the trend of the beehives in the upcoming years.

# Research questions
- How is the beehives population distributed throughout the world?
- How is the population changing over time?
- Influence of reduction/growth of beehives population?
- Does the reduction/growth of beehives affect other factors? 
- Can we find patterns why beehives reduce/grow in population?
- Will the bees survive? 

# Dataset
The datasets we are using is provided by FAOSTAT (Food and Agriculture Organization Statistics). It consists of 3 million time-series data related to food and agriculture split into 79 csv files. It contains data about 200 countries and what is more important for our use-case, it contains 8354 time-series records about the number of beehives.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

- Cleaning code
- First result
- Wrap up 

### 25. November (Deadline) 

# Questions for TAa
How to be sure that there is causation, and not only a correlation, between some outer factors and the number of beehives?
